History
-------
Video games were a major force behind moving computers into the mainstream for 
families in 1973, when Lemonade Stand was released. Even though hardware limitations
meant that games had to be very simple, games were still able to capture the time and 
imaginations of their users. Classics like Lemonade Stand still manage to do the same
today. Lemonade Stand, which was mainly marketed towards children, ended up being
viewed as a great introduction to business for children as well as a good way to 
introduce to families the positive and fun capabilities that a computer like the
Apple II could bring to their home. And it accomplished this by bringing together
two of the most important uses for a computer back in the day - video games and 
business.
